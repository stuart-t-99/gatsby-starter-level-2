The key problem to solve was that fraud was impacted EBITDA.

The solution was to assess the hourly call data feeds and where an anomaly was detected, that was highly likely fraud, an end to end automation would contact the customer, make the required changes to the service and then ensure all details were either written or retried from key downstrem system.

The result was a multi million dollar improvement in EBITDA.
